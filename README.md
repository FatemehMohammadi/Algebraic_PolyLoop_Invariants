# Algebraic Loop Invariant Synthesis

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Prototype implementation of an algorithm for computing polynomial invariants for polynomial loops with fixed initial values.</h3>

This repository contains the source files used for the benchmarks described in the ISSAC'24 submission:

* **Algebraic Tools for Computing Polynomial Loop Invariants** <br>*E. Bayarmagnai, F. Mohammadi, R. Pr√©bet*

The files, contained in the "benchmarks" directory, require [Macaulay2](https://macaulay2.com/) to be run. Each file corresponds to a benchmark, but they all implement the *same* algorithm.
